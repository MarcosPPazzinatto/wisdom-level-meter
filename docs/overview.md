## Project Documentation: Wisdom Level Meter

The Wisdom Level Meter is a digital level tool built with the RoboCore BlackBoard Wisdom. It uses the MMA8452Q accelerometer to detect the board's tilt and displays a bubble on the OLED screen to represent the current inclination. The bubble's radius can be adjusted with the onboard slider, and the interface updates in real time.

**Main components:**
- RoboCore BlackBoard Wisdom
- MMA8452Q Accelerometer
- SSD1306 OLED Display

**Features:**
- Displays a movable bubble according to board tilt
- Adjustable bubble radius
- Button to enable or disable "pro mode" (advanced features)
- Easy integration with additional sensors or features
