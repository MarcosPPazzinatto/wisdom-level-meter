# Wisdom Level Meter

This project implements a digital level meter using the RoboCore BlackBoard Wisdom. It measures the tilt angle of the board using the onboard accelerometer and displays a moving "bubble" on the integrated OLED display, simulating a classic spirit level. As you tilt the board, the bubble's position is updated in real time, allowing precise visualization of the inclination.

**Key features:**
- Real-time angle measurement using the MMA8452Q accelerometer.
- Interactive OLED display showing the current bubble position.
- Adjustable bubble radius using the onboard slider.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

Ideal for educational projects, demonstrations of sensor integration, and hands-on learning with microcontrollers.
